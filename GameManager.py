    Greetings to GameManager. This file's main purpose is managing current games, and allowing them to work. It does so by
    having multiple functions to create, delete, manage and play games, but also functionalities that allow people to vote
    for each other, add, delete, and manage lobbies, and making them work.

    Some methods of this file use Roles.py content. If you run into some random errors, please consider checking if
    Roles.py exists before going into some overcomplicated computer exorcism.

    This file's content will be described in depth here:

    CreateGame:
    CreateGame is the method responsible for creating new games, and referencing them in the central game unit (or CGU as it
    will be referenced further). If you are making your own version of this game, you should consider using CreateGame, and
    if you want to modify it, you will have to modify the entire CGU after that.
